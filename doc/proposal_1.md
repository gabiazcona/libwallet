# Libwallet

A lightweight and very portable library for creating chain agnostic wallets. 
It can be used in native applications, the browser and even embedded hardware.

## Design

The Wallet API comes with convenient abstractions and high level features

- Created around `Vault`s, an abstraction that makes it easier to support
  multiple backends that store private keys in different ways whether it is a
  cryptographic hardware module, a database or a file system.
